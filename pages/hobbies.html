                    When I was 8 years old I started skating classes. Since the moment I put the rollers on for the
                    first time, it became one of my biggest passions. For many years, I did <a class="link"
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_roller_skating" target="_blank">Artistic roller
                        skating</a>, and
                    even took part in several competitions.
                    However, 3 years ago I decided to make a change and buy inline roller blade shoes, in order to start
                    skating in the streets of the city (<a class="link"
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_skating" target="_blank">Inline skating</a>) and use
                    them as an additional workout, and sometimes even as
                    a
                    way of transportation.

                    Even though I am a huge fan of Math and science, I've always had an artistic side that really
                    characterizes me. I have loved painting, drawing and design in general since I was a little girl.
                    A few years ago, during covid, I found an old denim jacket in my closet and started painting it in
                    order to combat boredom. A few months later, some friends came to my house and saw that same jacket.
                    They went totally crazy and started asking for one for themselves. That is how I discovered that my
                    two passions, fashion and art, could be combined into not only a hobbie, but also an
                    entrepeneurship. That is how I started my own brand of hand-painted one of a kind denim jackets back
                    in Uruguay, which gave me the possibility making a living out of a hobbie.
